# TTB Canonical Wrapper Contract
## Pre-audited Infrastructure for Token Projects

The TTB Canonical Wrapper provides a ready-made, security-audited solution for projects looking to build on TTB. Instead of spending months developing and auditing custom token contracts, teams can deploy a pre-audited wrapper in minutes and focus on their core business logic.

## Value Proposition

### Why Use a Canonical Wrapper?
- **Immediate Deployment**: Launch your token in minutes instead of months
- **Proven Security**: Benefit from thorough security audits without the cost
- **Predictable Behavior**: Well-documented, tested functionality
- **Focus on Innovation**: Build your unique features on a solid foundation
- **Community Trust**: Users recognize and trust canonical implementations

### Cost Savings
Traditional token development requires:
- 2-3 months development time
- $50,000+ for security audits
- Ongoing maintenance and updates
- Security monitoring and patches

With a canonical wrapper:
- Deploy in under an hour
- Zero audit costs
- Maintenance handled by TTB
- Security guaranteed by design

## Technical Implementation

### Core Features
- Configurable wrap ratio (e.g., 1 TTB = 1000 project tokens)
- Optional unwrapping capability
- Standard ERC20 compliance
- Automatic supply management
- Clear event logging

### Deployment Steps
1. Clone the repository
2. Configure parameters:
   ```javascript
   const NAME = "Your Token";
   const SYMBOL = "TOKEN";
   const WRAP_RATIO = 1000;
   const ALLOW_UNWRAP = true;
   ```
3. Deploy to your network:
   ```bash
   yarn hardhat deploy --network your_network
   ```

### Integration Example
```solidity
// 1. Deploy wrapper
const wrapper = await deploy('TTBWrapper', {
  args: [TTB_ADDRESS, NAME, SYMBOL, WRAP_RATIO, ALLOW_UNWRAP]
});

// 2. Wrap TTB
await ttbContract.approve(wrapper.address, amount);
await wrapper.wrap(amount);
```
