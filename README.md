# TimeTickBase (TTB)
*Version 2.0 â€“ December 2024*

TimeTickBase is a time-based token system built on the Polygon network that creates a direct relationship between time and token generation through smart contracts.

## Core Principles

- One token is generated per second
- Immutable core contract
- Tokens can be staked individually via dapp or collectively through aggregator contract structures
- Staking is done in atomic units of one stake-hour (3,600 TTB) with a variable minimum stake
- 70% of new tokens go to stakers, 30% to development fund
- No premine, presale limited to 20% of initial token emissions

## Key Features

### Token Generation
- Fixed emission rate of 1 TTB per second
- Rewards claimable via dapp or by weekly batched release
- Based on Polygon (PoS) network timestamps
- No arbitrary minting or rate modification possible

### Staking System
- Individual staking with variable minimum stake
- Collective staking through aggregator contracts
- Two types of aggregator templates provided:
  1. On-ramp (single stake, no member stakes required)
  2. Full-stake (pooled stakes from all members)
- Aggregator contracts fully customizable

### Development Fund
- Zero premine
- Organic growth through token generation
- Multi-signature governance
- Transparent usage and reporting
- Emergency security measures

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Polygon network wallet
- Basic understanding of blockchain staking
- Meet minimum TTB for individual staking

### Staking Options
1. Individual Staking
   - Direct stake through main contract
   - Atomic stake-units (Multiples of 1 stake-hour)
   - Decreasing minimum stake-hour requirement

2. Collective Staking
   - Join an existing aggregator
   - Create new team aggregator contract

## Development Timeline

TBD - Reworking

## Security Features

- Professional security audits
- SafeMath operations
- Reentrancy protection
- Overflow protection
- Emergency pause capability
