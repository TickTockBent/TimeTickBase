# TimeTickBase (TTB)
## A Time-Based Token System with Team Staking
*Version 2.0 â€“ December 2024*

## Abstract

TimeTickBase (TTB) introduces a token system that creates a direct relationship between time and token generation through smart contracts. By implementing a fixed emission rate of one TTB per second and enabling staking for both individuals or collaboratively through team structures, TTB provides a foundation for the first time-based digital asset systems on the Polygon network.

## 1. Introduction

Time is humanity's most fundamental shared resource - universally measurable yet impossible to store or trade. While blockchain technology has enabled various forms of digital scarcity, no system has successfully created a direct relationship between time itself and token generation.

TimeTickBase addresses this by implementing a token system where emission is governed by the passage of time itself - exactly one TTB per second, immutably encoded in smart contracts. This creates a digital asset whose supply growth perfectly mirrors the flow of time, enabled by modern blockchain technology.

By tying token generation to an immutable physical law, the linear passage of time, TTB aims to be nothing less than the most incorruptible trustless token system ever created. Ambitious? Perhaps. But an ambition worth pursuing.

## 2. System Architecture

At its core, TTB implements a token generation system that mints exactly one TTB per second. This emission rate is immutable - encoded in smart contracts with no ability to arbitrarily mint additional tokens or modify the generation rate. The system batches these emissions (generally hourly) for efficient distribution, with ~3,600 tokens distributed in each hourly batch.

The generation mechanism relies on Polygon network block timestamps for time measurement. While this creates some variance in the precise second-by-second emission, the hourly batching system includes a total time verification step which ensures the correct total supply over time. The smart contract implements careful overflow protection and precision handling to maintain accurate token counts even at large numbers.

Distribution of newly generated tokens follows two distinct patterns based on network participation:

1. Without Active Stakers:
   - Development Fund receives 100% of emissions
   - Initial state prior to activation of Genesis Fountain

2. With Active Stakers:
   - 70% of new tokens are distributed proportionally among active stakers
   - 30% allocated to the development fund

## 3. Staking Mechanism

The staking system enables participants to lock TTB tokens and receive a portion of ongoing token generation. Stakes are made in units of one stake-hour (3,600 TTB) - symbolically representing one hour's worth of token generation. This creates a natural alignment between stake amounts and time periods. Because any stake below this amount confers no benefit, all staking is tracked in stake-hours, or atomic units of 3,600 TTB.

All staked tokens are subject to a timelock period to prevent rapid withdrawal and maintain system stability. The timelock period is based on time elapsed since token inception, implementing a variable lockup period that helps maintain network stability. The contracts implement comprehensive safety measures including reentrancy protection, balance verification, and atomic transaction handling.

To encourage collaboration and enable larger-scale participation, TTB implements two types of team staking through aggregator contracts:

1. On-ramp Aggregator
   - Counts as a single share (one stake-hour)
   - No member stake requirement
   - Rewards split evenly among all members
   - Easy on-ramp for new users to gain tokens, but low rewards
   - An official on-ramp will be maintained by the team after Genesis Fountain ends

2. Full-stake Aggregator
   - Pooled stake structure
   - Members transfer stake to leader on join
   - Stake returned to member on exit
   - Reward distribution configured by contract structure
   - Can implement timelock requirements or other requirements/incentives

## 4. Development Fund

The development fund plays a crucial role in ensuring sustainable system growth and maintenance. Unlike systems that rely on premines or token sales, TTB's development fund grows organically through ongoing token generation. This creates a more natural alignment between development resources and system growth.

Fund usage focuses on:
- Development costs
- Security audits
- Network infrastructure
- Staff compensation
- User acquisition
- System maintenance
- Quarterly public reporting

To ensure responsible fund management while maintaining operational flexibility, the fund implements several governance mechanisms:
- Multi-signature (3-of-5) requirement for withdrawals
- Variable increasing timelock on all withdrawal operations
- Maximum single withdrawal limits
- Public transaction records and quarterly reporting
- Emergency pause capability for security incidents

## 5. Technical Implementation

TTB is implemented as a set of smart contracts on the Polygon network. The core contracts handle:
1. Token generation and supply management
2. Stake deposits and withdrawals
3. Aggregator management and reward distribution
4. Development fund operations

The system leverages Polygon's efficient block times and low transaction costs to enable frequent reward distributions while maintaining reasonable gas costs for participants. All contracts undergo professional security audits and implement comprehensive safety measures including:
- SafeMath operations for all calculations
- Reentrancy guards on state-changing functions
- Precise overflow protection
- Robust access controls
- Emergency pause mechanisms

## 6. Initial Distribution Mechanism

### The Genesis Fountain

The initial token distribution leverages TTB's on-ramp aggregator system through a special implementation dubbed "The Genesis Fountain." This contract serves as the primary distribution mechanism during the network's first year, operating as a single share (one stake-hour) in the system while enabling broader initial participation.

The Genesis Fountain operates for 12 months from launch with the following structure:
- Fixed 50 slots
- Stakes a single share (1 stake-hour)
- Receives 70% of network emissions initially
- Natural dilution as stakers join

### Slot Distribution

The 50 Genesis Fountain slots are allocated through multiple channels:

* 10 slots - Community Development
  * Awarded to significant code contributors
  * Documentation and testing contributions
  * Technical community support
  
* 10 slots - Social Engagement
  * Content creation and education
  * Community building initiatives
  * Network awareness campaigns
  
* 10 slots - Random Selection
  * Public random drawing
  * Equal chance for all applicants
  * Community participation opportunity
  
* 10 slots - Development Reserve
  * Bug bounty rewards
  * Security contributions
  * Future community initiatives
  
* 10 slots - Development Funding
  * Available for purchase
  * Funds allocated to development costs
  * Smart contract audits and deployment

### Implementation Timeline

The Genesis Fountain follows a structured timeline to ensure controlled network growth:

1. First 3 months: Network stake-locked
   - No individual staking allowed
   - No new aggregator contracts accepted
   - Genesis Fountain will be the only share active

2. Months 4-12: Graduated opening
   - Genesis Fountain remains 1 stake-hour (1 share)
   - Open staking with natural dilution of fountain rewards
   - Minimum stake requirements:
     - Month 4: 25 stake-hours
     - Month 5: 15 stake-hours
     - Month 6: 10 stake-hours
     - Month 7: 5 stake-hours
     - Month 8: 1 stake-hour
   - After month 8: Free staking with 1 stake-hour minimum

### Reward Mechanics

The Genesis Fountain operates as a single stake-hour in the system, initially receiving 70% of all network emissions. These rewards are distributed among the 50 slot holders according to the contract's distribution logic. As additional timekeepers join the network, the Fountain's rewards naturally decrease - for example, when the first independent timekeeper stakes a valid share, the Fountain's rewards are proportionally reduced.

This mechanism ensures:
* Initial broad distribution of tokens
* Natural transition to decentralized participation
* No permanent advantages for early participants
* Gradual reduction of centralized distribution

The Genesis Fountain concludes operations exactly one year after network launch, at which point it ceases collecting rewards. This creates a clear timeline for transition to fully decentralized network participation through individual and team-based staking.

## 7. Governance

The system implements a timelord governance structure requiring:
- Large non-earning stake (exact amount TBD)
- 4:1 voting share on non-earning stake for timelords
- All timekeepers may vote on non-emergency proposals
- Multi-signature (3-of-5) requirement
- Variable timelock on withdrawals (longer for non-earning governance stake)

## 8. Development Roadmap

System development follows a phased approach:

Phase 1 (Q1 2025) focuses on core token mechanics: implementing the generation system, basic staking functionality, and essential security measures. This establishes the foundation for all future development.

Phase 2 (Q2 2025) introduces team staking capabilities: adding team contract deployment, member management systems, and configurable reward distribution. This enables coordinated participation and larger-scale staking operations.

Phase 3 (Q3 2025) emphasizes system optimization: improving performance, reducing gas costs, and enhancing state management. This ensures long-term system sustainability and efficiency.
