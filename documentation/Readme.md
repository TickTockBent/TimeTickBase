# TimeTickBase (TTB)

TimeTickBase is a time-based token system built on the Polygon network that creates a direct relationship between time and token generation through smart contracts.

## Core Principles

- One token is generated per second, immutably
- Tokens can be staked individually or through team structures
- Minimum stake is 86,400 TTB (one day's worth of tokens)
- 70% of new tokens go to stakers, 30% to development fund

## Key Features

### Token Generation
- Fixed emission rate of 1 TTB per second
- Hourly batch distribution (~3,600 tokens per batch)
- Based on Polygon network timestamps
- No arbitrary minting or rate modification possible

### Staking System
- Individual staking with minimum 86,400 TTB
- Team staking through aggregator contracts
- Two types of aggregators:
  1. On-ramp (single stake, no member stakes required)
  2. Full-stake (pooled stakes from all members)

### Development Fund
- Organic growth through token generation
- Multi-signature governance
- Transparent usage and reporting
- Emergency security measures

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Polygon network wallet
- Basic understanding of blockchain staking
- Minimum 86,400 TTB for individual staking

### Staking Options
1. Individual Staking
   - Direct stake through main contract
   - Minimum one stake-day (86,400 TTB)

2. Team Staking
   - Join an existing aggregator
   - Create new team aggregator contract
   - Participate in Genesis Fountain (initial distribution)
