# TTB Temple Pattern Specification

## Overview

The TTB Temple Pattern provides a radically simple approach to blockchain service provision. While traditional solutions involve complex pricing models and implementation overhead, Temples offer a straightforward proposition: stake TTB tokens, get guaranteed service. No usage calculations, no hidden fees, no ongoing maintenance - just stake and use.

Unlike traditional service implementations that require careful cost modeling and ongoing payments, the Temple model is completely predictable: stake X amount of TTB and receive guaranteed service with potential improvements over time. Your capital remains intact and withdrawable, with the service effectively paid for through foregone stake earnings.

## Service Model

### Core Concept
- Provides guaranteed service levels to projects
- Projects stake TTB tokens in special non-earning contract (Temple)
- Stake earnings redirected to cover service costs
- Possible service improvements with adoption
- Capital remains withdrawable

### Implementation Model

#### Basic Temple Structure
- Service Definition
  * Clear service parameters
  * Quality/quantity metrics
  * Access methods
  * Support levels

- Economics
  * Service Cost Analysis
  * Target Margin (typically 50%)
  * Required Coverage Calculation
  * Minimum Team Stakes
  * Total Stake Requirements

- Scaling Options
  * Service improvement tiers
  * Adoption-based upgrades
  * Cost sharing benefits
  * Network effect incentives

### Network Effects
- Service cost per team may decrease with adoption
- Service quality can improve with adoption
- Teams incentivized to recruit others
- Natural viral growth potential

## Implementation

### Contracts Required
1. Temple Interface Contract
   - Service interface
   - Quality management
   - Status tracking
   - Emergency controls

2. Special Stake Contract
   - TTB stake management
   - Reward redirection
   - Service access control
   - Team tracking

### Safety Mechanisms
- Minimum verification periods before upgrades
- Service level protection
- Stake reserve requirements
- Emergency pause capabilities
- Dev fund backup options

## Dynamic Price Adjustment

### Price Oracle Integration
- TTB price monitoring
- Stake requirement adjustments
- New customer onboarding rates
- Grandfather protection for existing users

### Cost Management
- Service cost tracking
- Margin maintenance
- Stake requirement updates
- Economic balancing

## Value Proposition

### Cost Comparison

Traditional Service Implementation:
- Variable service costs
- Development time
- Ongoing maintenance
- Token/payment management
- Hidden costs and complexity
- Usage monitoring and adjustments

Temple Model:
- Stake fixed amount of TTB
- Retain and withdraw capital any time
- No usage calculations needed
- No ongoing payments
- Possible service improvements
- Zero maintenance overhead

## Monitoring Requirements

### Service Metrics
- Service quality measurements
- Usage tracking
- Cost analysis
- Team participation levels

### Financial Metrics
- TTB price tracking
- Stake earnings
- Service cost tracking
- Margin calculations

### Alert Systems
- Service degradation
- System failures
- Cost anomalies
- Team count changes

## Strategic Vision

### Infrastructure Potential
The Temple Pattern can become a standard model for web3 service provision through:
- Predictable costs for users
- Self-sustaining economics
- Built-in incentive alignment
- Simple, understandable model

### Friction Reduction
The key to adoption is eliminating common friction points:
- Replace complex implementations
- Eliminate usage calculations
- Remove token management overhead
- Provide clear service guarantees

### Network Effects
- Services can improve with adoption
- Costs may decrease per project
- Natural viral growth incentives
- Self-reinforcing value proposition

## Template Usage

To implement a new Temple:
1. Define clear service parameters and costs
2. Calculate required stake based on:
   - Service costs
   - Target margin
   - TTB price
   - Staking APR
3. Implement standard Temple interfaces
4. Deploy with appropriate safety controls
5. Monitor and adjust as needed

## Conclusion

The Temple Pattern provides a framework for sustainable service provision while maintaining self-sustainability through an innovative stake-for-service model. The potential for service improvements creates natural network effects and incentivizes adoption while keeping the model simple for users.
